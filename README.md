# LongitudinalVehicleDynamicsCalculator
Longitudinal Vehicle Dynamics Calculator created in MATLAB based on my project during Studies in Vehicle Dynamics Course

# Limitations 

- Comments and code is on Serbian Language
- Calculation of I0(differential gear ratio) is based on maximum Vehicle Speed and maximum RPMs of engine. There are better ways to calculate this.
- Calculation of gear ratio of first gear(i1) is based on check of traction force or check of maximum force for achieving requested maximum slope value
- Calculation in of gear ratios between the gears is limited to a case that there can be 5 gears, 4th gear must be 1 and 5th must have overdrive value. 

# Output 
- Calculated values are put into .xls named VucniProracun.xls
